My intro to the Github community

Hi everyone!

My name is Nicolas and I'm very new to the github community. I'm eager to learn more about coding. I'm majoring in Computer Science, so I know this will add even more value to my ever growing coding skills. I've previously coded in Java, C++, and Python but I'm also learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Love the great outdoors, gaming, and messing with computers in my off time.
